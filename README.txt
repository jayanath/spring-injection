This is a simple application to demonstrate how to use Spring Framework
for dependency injection.

The application has a hotel room and some injected services in to the hotel room.

Pre-requisites to run the application:
[1]Java run time environment or JDK
[2] Apache Ant

To run the application:
[1]Download the zip file or clone the source code
[2]If you download the zip file, the file name would look like "jayanath-spring-injection-some_random_number".
   If you want to import the code to an IDE, rename the folder to "spring-injection" before import.
   Otherwise the IDE would create a seperate folder named "spring-injection" during the import.Then when you try to
   run the application, the IDE will try to read the config files from that newly created folder and fail.
[3]Go to the root of the application and type ant. This will call the default ant
   target that compile, package and execute the application.
